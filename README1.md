# Welcome to Nashville: An itinerary for a day trip to Music City by The Smoldering Vertexes

This application allows Nashville tourists to easily search one of four different areas of local entertainment such as parks, breweries, concerts, and restaurants at a time.  Users can then add their search results to an itinerary on the same page by clicking on a button that prints along with the search result. 

1. Concert Search:
In the concernt search bar displayed on the page, users may enter any keyword relating to an artist's name or title of concert to reveal whether or not said concert is available.  The search result will either return more than one concert containing the keyword, one result, or 'No music for you :(' if the concert is unavailable.  Each search result will print with an individual 'Save' button if there are search results returned.  The chosen result will then print to an itinerary below the search section.  The user must use proper capitalization for the search results to render correctly, as the key words are case sensitive.

2. Parks
User can narrow down their options for local parks
